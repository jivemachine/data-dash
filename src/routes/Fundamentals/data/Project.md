    # Data Science: Skills In Demand
    
    ## Project Objectives
    
    Find current skills that are in demand for current data jobs.
    
    - Using LinkedIn, Indeed, or other aggregators, find *3 job postings* that have a job title like "Data Scientist", "Data Analyst", "Data Engineer", or "Machine Learning Engineer".
    - Do sound research by following the scientific method in your work and keeping as many of your variables consistent while varying only one or two. Basically, pick the same area of focus to compare and contrast across your three job postings.
    - Examples:
        - Data Scientist 1 jobs in three different locations in the same industry
        - Data Scientist postings across 3 different levels at the same company
        - Data Scientist vs. Data Analyst vs. Data Engineer all in San Antonio at tech companies
    
    ## Audience
    
    Your audience is aspiring Data Scientists, and your goal is to educate them on the skills employers are looking for as well as other information you gain in your research, such as challenges one might encounter when applying, how to find the role that fits the applicant's needs, what a career path might look like, what one can and cannot learn from the job descriptions, etc.
    
    ## Deliverable
    
    Slide show presentation
    
    - summarize findings
    - canva.com is recommended for slide creation
    - 6 slides or less in total
    - 2-4 minutes (absolutely no longer than 5 minutes)
    
    ## Project Specifications
    
    ### **Title slide**
    
    *This is where you introduce yourself*
    
    - name
    - date
    - descriptive title of presentation
    
    ### **Executive summary slide (summary slide)**
    
    *This is where you introduce your project and what you found*
    
    - your project goal(s)
    - your key findings
    - your takeaways and recommendations
    
    When you think about what should be included as a key finding, think about it like this: if I can only remember 1-3 things about your research, what should I remember?
    
    ### **Content slides (1-3 slides)**
    
    *This is where you give us the details*
    
    - the job role / title
    - the company name
    - location
    - industry
    - line of business the role falls in (e.g. Marketing, Sales, R&D, HR, Customer Support)
    - the most appealing aspect of the job to you
    - the least appealing aspect of the job to you
    - the most important technical skills for this role
    - the most important soft skills for this role
    - the link to the posting to cite your source
    - and any additional comments or observations you find important or useful
    
    ### **Conclusion slide**
    
    *This is where you tell us what you want us to remember*
    
    This should tie everything up with a bow. What is the **one** thing you want the audience to walk away from your presentation remembering, the last thing you want them to hear? It should have very minimal text on it, be simple, and to the point. And saying thank you is always a good thing!
