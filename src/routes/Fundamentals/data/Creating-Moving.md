    # Creating and Moving
    
    There are a number of ways to create files and directories on the linux filesystem. We are going to show you some of the most common commands.
    
    ## touch
    
    How do we create new files from the command line? Just like this:
    
    `% touch newfile.txt`
    
    The `touch` command allows us to create a new empty file of whatever name we specify. In this case, our file will show up like this:
    
    ```bash
    % ls -l
    
    -rw-r--r--   1 user  wheel         0 Nov 18 11:00 newfile.txt
    ```
    
    You can even create multiple files at once, like this:
    
    `% touch one two three four five`
    
    ## mkdir
    
    What if we want to create a directory? There is the `mkdir` command:
    
    `% mkdir secret_plans`
    
    What happens to your desktop if you `cd` to it, and make this directory?
    
    Just like `touch`, you can create multiple directories inside your current one simultaneously:
    
    `% mkdir one two three four`
    
    ## mv
    
    Occasionally we want to move files from one location to another. We can use the following command, and our path, to accomplish this.
    
    `mv` needs two pieces of information, or arguments, to work. The first is the original file you want to move, the second is the location where you want to move it.
    
    `% mv ~/newfile.txt ~/Desktop/newfile.txt`
    
    This command moves our `newfile.txt` from the home directory, and puts it on our Desktop. What if you only want to use relative paths? Let's say you were already in your home directory:
    
    ```bash
    % pwd
    /Users/john
    ```
    
    You run `ls` to see what files are in there:
    
    ```bash
    % ls -a
    .
    ..
    newfile.txt
    ```
    
    Now, we know where we are, and we know where we want to go, so let's specify our current file and the location to move it to using relative paths.
    
    `% mv newfile.txt ../newfile.txt`
    
    This would move the file up one directory from our current location.
    
    `mv` can also rename files with a slight variation in our syntax:
    
    `% mv current_filename.txt new_filename.txt`
    
    This would not actually move our file from its current directory, but it would rename it inside of our current directory.
    
    ## Exercise
    
    1. Create a new directory on your desktop called "test".
    2. Create some new files in there, named "test1", "test2", and "test3".
    3. Create another directory inside of test, called "secret_files".
    4. Create some new files inside of that.
    5. Navigate back to your desktop and run `ls -l test`. What do you see?
    6. Now try `ls -l test/secret_files`. Do you see your secret files?
    7. Try running `ls -R test`. What does the `R` flag do?
    8. Create a file inside of the `test` named `.hidden_file`. Does this file show up when you run `ls`? What could you do to make it show up?
    9. You've seen that we can create hidden files by prepending the file name with a `.`. Does this also work for directories? Try to create a hidden directory and add files to it. Do all the files in a hidden directory need to be hidden files?
    10. Create a new file on your desktop called "move_it.txt".
    11. Move this file into your home directory.
    12. Now move it into your documents folder, where it belongs.
    13. Change the name of the file, within your documents folder, to `important.txt`.
